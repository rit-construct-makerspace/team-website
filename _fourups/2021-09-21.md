## 4-Up

### Progress
- Team Website Deployment
- Prototyping web app (w/ Material Design)
- Trello Board Setup
- GitHub Access Management
- Time Tracking Graphs
- Domain Model Remade
- Confirm the tools/techniques will be used for the project
- Develop and implement a methodology


### Plans
- Submit waiting for approval actions/deliverables to Senior project website
- Continue prototyping frontend


### Risks
- Tiger Bucks portal is manual operation only
- Mitigation: include link at end of material purchase flow, and make purchases in-person only
  - Question: how do we handle payment for printing in that case?
    - Possible answer: payment required before we hand the print to you


### Needs
